**Artificial Intelligence**, particularly **Generative Artificial Intelligence**, is taking over the world. It represents the most disruptive, useful, and frightening tool of recent years. Capable of giving chills to [some](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/ai-uncanny-valley) and fascinating others (like me). Whatever your case may be, in this article we will explore the different ways you already use or can use [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).

First, let's start by understanding the concept in a simple way.

> [Here](https://4geeks.com/lesson/artificial-intelligence-in-simple-terms) is a more detailed article with some important concepts.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

**Artificial Intelligence** (AI) is a branch of computer science dedicated to creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include voice recognition, decision making, language translation, and much more. AI is based on algorithms and mathematical models that allow machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time.

## What is Generative AI?

[Generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new and original content. Unlike other forms of AI that are limited to analyzing and classifying existing data, Generative AI can produce text, images, music, and other types of content from patterns and previous examples. This is achieved through the use of deep neural networks and advanced models like [transformers](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/21/what-is-a-transformer-model/).

## What are the existing uses of AI?

AI is already present in many areas of our daily lives, often without us realizing it. Some of the most common uses include:

- *Spam filtering in email*: AI algorithms analyze incoming emails and [classify them as spam or not spam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights/journeys/spam-checker).
- *Image classification*: Photo applications use AI to recognize and tag people, places, and objects in images.
- *Virtual assistants*: [Siri](https://www.apple.com/siri/), [Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/alexa-skills/b?ie=UTF8&node=13727921011), and [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/) use AI to understand and respond to our questions.
- *Content recommendations*: Platforms like [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) and [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) use AI to suggest movies, series, and music based on our tastes and consumption habits.

## What are the most popular platforms to use AI?

There are numerous platforms that allow users to harness the power of AI for various applications. Some of the most popular include:

- *[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)*: A language model developed by OpenAI that can generate coherent and relevant text in response to user inputs. You can also use **GPTs** from the GPTStore to enhance AI capabilities, generate images, and soon even talk to the model as if it were human, with a voice suspiciously similar to Scarlett Johansson's. It costs $20 per month for personal use.
- *[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/)*: A platform that uses AI to generate impressive art and graphics from textual descriptions. You can use it on the platform (beta) or through Discord, with different subscriptions depending on the use case.
- *[Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/), [Stable Video](https://www.stablevideo.com/generate)*: Tools that allow the creation of high-quality images and videos using AI. You can recharge coins within the platform and generate images with them, adjusting various generation parameters such as style, aspect ratio, steps the model takes to generate the image, and many more.
- *[Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)*: An AI-based search engine that provides precise and contextual answers to user queries. It is useful for the AI model to connect to the internet and get updated information for the user's query. You can use it for free, but it also has paid plans.
- *[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app?hl=en)*: A Google AI platform that offers advanced solutions for business process automation and optimization. It can analyze videos or images and has a context window of up to 2 million tokens, allowing you to pass entire books to the model and ask questions about them. You can use it for free for personal use with your Google account.
- *[There is an AI for that](https://theresanaiforthat.com/)*: A repository of AI tools for various applications, from photo editing to content generation. Perfect for enthusiasts looking to improve their workflow with various new tools. More are always being added, and the trend is expected to continue. It is free, as you only consult the available tools.
- *[Canva](https://www.canva.com/)*: A graphic design tool that uses AI to facilitate the creation of attractive and professional designs. It has a free and paid plan, but if you want to use AI, you will have to pay a subscription at some point.
- *[Adobe Firefly](https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly.html)*: With its suite of products, Adobe incorporates AI to enhance photo, video, and other creative content editing. With Adobe Firefly, professional image editing has become a simpler, more dynamic, and creative task that allows you to experiment with various styles at the reach of a [prompt](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-a-prompt).
- *[Runway](https://runwayml.com/)*: A platform that offers AI tools for creating multimedia content, including video and graphics. It allows you to sync lips from a video or image and audio, generate videos, extend them in time or size, and much more. You start with a free plan, but for some features, you will need to pay a subscription.

### And many, many more.

In summary, Generative Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing the way we interact with technology and digital content. Whether you are fascinated or intimidated by it, it is undeniable that AI is here to stay and will continue to transform our lives in surprising and innovative ways.
