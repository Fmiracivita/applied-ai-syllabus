The world changed when ChatGPT was released. I remember the moment I saw the first news about it, shortly after news about Dall-E had come out, and I had tried it. That's why when I saw ChatGPT, I wanted to try it.

Many of the news articles said it was a revolution similar to what had happened with the internet. I confirmed this when I tried it for the first time. Its responses were nothing like those of other chatbots at the time, and that's because ChatGPT is not a chatbot like the ones we were used to, with programmatic, nonsensical responses.

ChatGPT gives us a chat interface with which we can interact with a large language model or LLM (Large Language Model).

> An LLM is a type of artificial intelligence model that interprets natural language and gives us a response based on the knowledge acquired during the training phase by its neural network. [Here you can learn more basic concepts of artificial intelligence](https://4geeks.com/lesson/artificial-intelligence-in-simple-terms)

Depending on how good our text input or "prompt" is, the language model's responses will be better or worse depending on the use case. > And if you want to learn how to make good prompts, I leave you an article about them, avoid hallucinations and [take your prompting to the next level](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-a-prompt)!

That's why in this guide, I will teach you how to use ChatGPT from scratch.

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is an application developed by OpenAI that uses artificial intelligence to generate coherent and contextual text. Unlike other chatbots, ChatGPT can understand and respond to a wide variety of questions and topics, making it extremely versatile. The engine of ChatGPT is OpenAI's language models, for the free version `gpt-4o-mini`, and the paid version uses `gpt-4o`, its most advanced model.

## How to Use ChatGPT: Step by Step

### 1. Create an Account on OpenAI

To start using ChatGPT, you first need to create an account on OpenAI. Visit [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/) and follow the instructions to sign up.

### 2. Access ChatGPT

Once you have an account, you can access ChatGPT from the OpenAI dashboard. [Here you can start a new conversation with the model](https://chatgpt.com/).

### 3. Write a Prompt

The next step is to write a "prompt" or text input. This is the message or question you will ask ChatGPT. For example, you can write "What is the capital of France?" and ChatGPT will respond with "Paris".

### 4. Evaluate the Response

After receiving the response from ChatGPT, evaluate whether it is useful and accurate. If you are not satisfied with the response, you can adjust your prompt to get a better answer.

### 5. Use ChatGPT for Different Applications

ChatGPT can be used for a variety of applications, from answering simple questions to generating complex content. Here are some ideas:

- **Task Assistance**: Ask about academic topics or specific tasks.
- **Content Generation**: Use ChatGPT to help you write articles, blogs, or even books.
- **Customer Service**: Implement ChatGPT on your website to answer frequently asked questions from customers.

## Using GPTstore

In addition to the basic models, [ChatGPT allows you to use the GPTStore](https://chatgpt.com/gpts), a catalog of models created by people that will allow you to do everything with ChatGPT, from creating websites to videos, solving math problems, and more. You could also customize the model's behavior and upload your data, but you will need to pay for the **ChatGPT** subscription for that.

## Generating Images with ChatGPT

You can ask ChatGPT to generate images; it will use Dall-E-3 for that. In the free version, you can generate up to two images a day.
> Tip: You can first ask it to generate a description, iterate on it, and when you have a description of what you want, ask it to generate it!

## Tips for Getting Better Results

- **Be Clear and Concise**: The clearer and more specific your prompt is, the better the response will be.
- **Use Context**: Provide additional context if necessary to get a more accurate response.
- **Iterate and Improve**: Don't hesitate to adjust and improve your prompts to get better results.

## Conclusion

ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can transform the way we interact with technology. From task assistance to content generation, the possibilities are endless. Now that you know how to use ChatGPT, it's time to start exploring its capabilities!
