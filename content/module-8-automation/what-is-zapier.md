### ü§ñ What is Zapier?

**Zapier** is a no-code automation platform that connects your favorite apps to create custom workflows, known as **Zaps**. Think of it as a bridge that allows different apps to "talk" to each other and exchange information seamlessly. With over **7,000 integrations**, Zapier can connect tools like Gmail, Slack, Google Sheets, Trello, Asana, Shopify, and thousands more.

At its core, Zapier works by using **triggers** and **actions**:

- A **trigger** is an event that starts a workflow (e.g., receiving a new email).
- An **action** is the task Zapier performs after the trigger is activated (e.g., saving the email's details to a spreadsheet).

For example:

- **Trigger**: A new lead is added to your CRM.
- **Action**: Send a welcome email to the lead and notify your sales team in Slack.

Zapier empowers you to automate tasks with no coding skills required, making it accessible to everyone from tech experts to complete beginners.

### üöÄ How to Use Zapier: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide

1. **Sign Up and Log In**: Create an account on Zapier (free and paid plans are available).
2. **Choose Your Apps**: Select the apps you want to connect. For instance, Gmail and Google Sheets.
3. **Set Up a Trigger**: Decide what event will start your workflow. For example, "When I receive a new email in Gmail."
4. **Add an Action**: Specify what Zapier should do when the trigger occurs. For example, "Add the email details to a Google Sheet."
5. **Test Your Zap**: Run a test to ensure everything works as intended.
6. **Turn it On**: Once you're happy with your Zap, turn it on and let automation handle the rest!

### ‚öôÔ∏è Limitations of the Free Plan

While Zapier‚Äôs free plan is a great entry point, it does come with some limitations. Here are the key restrictions:

1. **Two-Step Zaps Only**: On the free plan, you're limited to workflows with only one trigger and one action. For instance, "When I receive a new email (trigger), save it to Google Sheets (action)." More complex, multi-step Zaps require a paid plan.
2. **Task Limit**: Free users are allowed up to **100 tasks per month**. A task is any action performed by a Zap (e.g., sending an email or adding a row to a spreadsheet).
3. **15-Minute Update Interval**: Zaps on the free plan check for new data every 15 minutes, which could introduce small delays in automation.
4. **No Premium App Integrations**: Some advanced apps and features (like Salesforce or paths/conditional logic) are only accessible on paid plans.

While the free plan is sufficient for small-scale automations, upgrading to a paid plan unlocks Zapier‚Äôs full potential with multi-step Zaps, premium apps, and more frequent updates.
